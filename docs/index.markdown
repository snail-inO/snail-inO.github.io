# Welcome

I am a Master student in Computer Engineering Program studying at [Syracuse Univerity](https://www.syracuse.edu/) since 2021. And I work as a research assistant in [FullStack Security Lab](https://tristartom.github.io/members.html) advised by [Prof. Yuzhe Tang](https://tristartom.github.io/index.html).

My research interests lie in Blockchain Security.

I received my B.E. Degree in Automation from [South China Agricultural University](https://english.scau.edu.cn/) in 2017.
